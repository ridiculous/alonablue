      </div>
      <div class="card_body bordered">
        <p>
          We set sail from Tagbilaran Yacht Club with great views of the coastlines of Panglao, Bohol and Cebu Islands.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we arrive at Panglao Nature Resort we drop anchor and itâ€™s time for some great snorkeling and swimming.
          We are happy to provide you with top quality masks, snorkels and booties along with floatation jackets if you
          need them. Our crew will help you get comfortably fitted with your gear and then escort you into the water to
          be of assistance if you need them. We serve your lunch after snorkelling and swimming around 12 noon or 1 in
          the afternoon. Then we set sail again for our return trip.
